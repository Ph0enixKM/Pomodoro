# Pomodoro üçÖ
Pomodoro is a program to help you stay productive during the day. 
This is a C-written implementation for Linux operating systems.
Pomodoro uses a raw **Xlib** for creating a native window.

# Installation
Just install this [pomodoro.deb](https://github.com/Ph0enixKM/Pomodoro/releases/latest) file on Debian based OS.

# Usage
Once launched a counter will appear. It will send you notifications to keep you informed while not distracting you from your job. 
Once the counter finishes the computer will shut down, so that you can't cheat and slack off.
